Practical Python Programming â€” Completed Course

This repository contains my completed work and exercises from David Beazleyâ€™s Practical Python Programming
 course.

ðŸ“š What I learned

Throughout the course, I covered a wide range of Python topics, including:

Core Python: numbers, strings, files, exceptions, modules

Data structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets

Program organization: functions, modules, error handling, script structure

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): classes, methods, inheritance, special methods

Generators & Iterators: lazy evaluation, pipelines, streaming data

Advanced concepts:

*args and **kwargs

lambda functions & closures

decorators

static & class methods

Testing & Debugging: unittest, logging, debugging tools, profiling

Packaging & Distribution: packages, __init__.py, virtual environments, dependencies

ðŸŽ¯ Why this is important

This course helped me:

Build a solid foundation in Python programming

Learn best practices for structuring and testing code

Understand both basic and advanced features of Python

Gain hands-on experience by completing dozens of exercises

ðŸš€ Next Steps

Now that Iâ€™ve finished this course, I plan to:

Apply Python in real projects (automation, data analysis, web development)

Continue learning advanced topics (machine learning, async programming, Django/FastAPI)
